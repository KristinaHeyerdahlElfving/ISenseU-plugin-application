ISenseU PhoneGap plugin application for iOS


This application was developed to work with the ISenseU sensor, developed by Sintef IKT. It is implemented using the cross platform mobile application development tool PhoneGap, and uses a Bluetooth Smart plugin to communicate with the sensor. 

The application is developed for the iOS platform, and the user interface is customized for the iPhone 5. 

The code is entirely written by Kristina Heyerdahl Elfving as a part of her master thesis at Sintef IKT.
